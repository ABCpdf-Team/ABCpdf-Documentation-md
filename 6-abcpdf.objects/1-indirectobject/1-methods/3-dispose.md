| You can call this function to explicitly dispose of an object and reduce the garbage collection overhead. This method follows the standard design pattern for objects implementing the IDisposable interface. The protected Dispose method can be overridden for sub-classes wishing to dispose of additional objects. Do not attempt to use an object after calling Dispose. |  |  |
