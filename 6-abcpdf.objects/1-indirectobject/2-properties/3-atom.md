# Atom Property

## Notes

The Atom contained by the IndirectObject.

Atoms can only be contained by one object at a time. So - if you assign a new Atom to this property and the supplied Atom is currently contained by another object - a clone of the Atom will be inserted rather than a reference to the original.

## Example

None.
