|  |  | ImageLayer Class |  |  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  | 
| A generic bitmap layer appearing on a page of the document. The actual bitmap data is held separately in a PixMap object. The ImageLayer merely references the bitmap and describes where and how it should be drawn. This is analogous to the way that images are embedded in HTML. ``` System.Object WebSupergoo.ABCpdf13.Objects.IndirectObject WebSupergoo.ABCpdf13.Objects.StreamObject WebSupergoo.ABCpdf13.Objects.Layer WebSupergoo.ABCpdf13.Objects.ImageLayer ``` |  |  |
