# InsertRange Method

Inserts the certificate objects to this collection for those whose values are not already present.

## Syntax

[C#]

```csharp
int InsertRange(int index, X509Certificate2[] certs)int InsertRange(int index, <a href="../default.htm">Signature.CertificateCollection</a> certs, int startIndex, int count)
```

## Params

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| index | The index into this collection for insertion. |
| certs | An array of System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2 objects; or a Signature.CertificateCollection object. |
| startIndex | The index of the first certificate object in certs to add. |
| count | The number of certificate objects in certs to add. |
| return | The number of certificate objects added. |

## Notes

These methods insert the certificate objects to this collection for those whose values are not already present. Signature.CertificateCollection does not store duplicate certificates, so only one certificate object among each set of duplicates is added.
