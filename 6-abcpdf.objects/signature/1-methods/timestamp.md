# Timestamp Function

Sign a document timestamp signature field using a Timestamping Authority (TSA).

## Syntax

**[C#]**

```csharp
virtual void Timestamp(Oid oid, int reserve)
virtual void Timestamp(Oid oid, DataType dataType, int reserve)
```

<span class=language>[Visual Basic]</span>  

```
Overridable Sub Timestamp(oid As Oid, reserve As int)
Overridable Sub Timestamp(oid As Oid, dataType as DataType, reserve As int)
```
`may throw Exception()`

## Params

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| oid | The hash algorithm to use to create the digest of the document data, for example new Oid("SHA256"). | 
| reserve | The number of bytes to reserve for the returned signed timestamp data. A typical value might be in the region of 5000. If the value is too small an exception will be raised. This value is only relevant if you are using a CustomSigner. | 
| dataType | The type of data to be passed to the CustomSigner and expected back from it. This value is only relevant if you are using a CustomSigner or CustomSigner2. For details of the possible values and what they mean, see the Sign method. | 

## Notes

Sign a document timestamp signature field using a Timestamping Authority (TSA).

The signature must be an unsigned RFC 3161 timestamp signature. If you need to create such a signature you can do so using the [XForm.AddDocTimestamp](../../../5-abcpdf/xform/1-methods/adddoctimestamp.md) method.

You need to set one of either the [TimestampServiceUrl](../2-properties/TimestampServiceUrl.md) or the [CustomSigner](../2-properties/customsigner.md) properties before calling this function. The TimestampServiceUrl is preferred over the CustomSigner if both are set.

If you are using a CustomSigner the delegate method will be passed the raw SHA256 digest of the object to be time stamped (i.e. the document contents). It should return a DER representation of a timestamp token as defined in RFC 3161.

The timestamp signing operation is queued so you will typically want to call [Doc.Save](../../../5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/save.md) or [Commit](commit.md) after calling this function.

## Example

None.
