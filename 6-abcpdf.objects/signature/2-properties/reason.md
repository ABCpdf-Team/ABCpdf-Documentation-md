## Notes

The reason for signing.

If you wish to set a value for this property, you should do so before calling the Sign function.

This property can take null as a value. This indicates that no reason was given.

Note that this property can only be relied on if the certificate is valid. You can check whether the certificate is valid using the Validate function.
