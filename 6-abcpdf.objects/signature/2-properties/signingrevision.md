# SigningRevision Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp int ``` [Visual Basic] `int` | See description. | Yes | The revision at which the signature was signed. | 

## Notes

The revision at which the signature was signed.

Content can be added to a document after signature. Most commonly this occurs if someone wishes to countersign an already signed document.

The original signature remains valid because it applies to the original document but you may wish to indicate that the document has been changed.

If the document has been modified in this way the SigningRevision will be less than the [Doc.ObjectSoup.Revisions](../../2-objectsoup/2-properties/5-revisions.md).

To detect the actual visible differences you would need to render the document at each revision using the XReadOptions.SkipRevisions property.

Note that you should check the [IsModified](ismodified.md) property before relying on the value of this property.

## Example

None.
