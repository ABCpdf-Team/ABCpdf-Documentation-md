- RawDigest - When signing the callback will be provided with a hashed digest of the document data.
- TimeStampDigest - When time stamping provide the callback with a hashed digest, the time stamp message imprint, rather than an RFC 3161 time stamp request.
- TimeStampToken - When time stamping the callback will return a time stamp token rather than an RFC 3161 time stamp response.
- NoEmbeddedTimeStampUrl - Do not use any supplied URL to embed a time stamp.
- NoEmbeddedTimeStampCustom - Do not use any supplied callback to embed a time stamp.
