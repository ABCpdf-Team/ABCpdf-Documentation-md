# FieldBorderColor Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp XColor ``` [Visual Basic] `XColor` | n/a | No | The border color of the field. | 

## Notes

This property is used to access or change the border color of a field.

This property is only valid if this annotation is associated with a form field.

If you assign a color to this property the color supplied must be grayscale, RGB or CMYK. A value of null indicates that the border is transparent.

When you set this property a clone of the XColor you assign is created to avoid one XColor being shared by multiple annotations.

After changing this property you will need to call [UpdateAppearance](../1-methods/updateappearance.md) to realize the change.

## Example

None.
