| Use this method to permanently stamp an annotation into the page on which it is located. When this method is called the annotation appearance is stamped permanently into the document and the annotation is deleted. The annotation becomes a new layer on the page (see Doc.LayerCount) so you may wish to call Doc.Flatten on the affected page. |  |  |
