# TextEnd  Property

## Notes

The offset to the character (in the FullText) which will be drawn as the next item in the chain.

By changing this property you can control the character at which the next item in the chain starts. So by increasing the value you can skip characters between chained items. By decreasing the value you can repeat text from the previous item.

## Example

None.
