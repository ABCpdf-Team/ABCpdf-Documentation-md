# InfoAuthor Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp string ``` [Visual Basic] `string` | null | No | The Author entry within the Metadata | 

## Notes

The Author entry within the [Metadata](../default.md).

This corresponds to the dc:creator entry.

The PDF 2.0 Specification states that this corresponds to the dc:author entry, but this seems to be a mistake since all related specifications and indeed all examples in the PDF 2.0 specification use the dc:creator.

## Example

Also see example code in: [Catalog Metadata Property](../../catalog/2-properties/metadata.md).
