| The Author entry within the Metadata. This corresponds to the dc:creator entry. The PDF 2.0 Specification states that this corresponds to the dc:author entry, but this seems to be a mistake since all related specifications and indeed all examples in the PDF 2.0 specification use the dc:creator. |  |  |
