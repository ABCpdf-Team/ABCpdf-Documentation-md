# InfoAuthor Property

## Notes

The Author entry within the Metadata.

This corresponds to the dc:creator entry.

The PDF 2.0 Specification states that this corresponds to the dc:author entry, but this seems to be a mistake since all related specifications and indeed all examples in the PDF 2.0 specification use the dc:creator.

## Example

Also see example code in: Catalog Metadata Property.
