# Add Function

Adds an object to the Soup.

## Syntax

**[C#]**

```csharp
int Add(IndirectObject value)
```

**[Visual Basic]**

`Function Add(value As IndirectObject) As Integer`
## Params

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| value | The IndirectObject to be added. | 
| return | The position in which the new element was inserted. | 

## Notes

This method adds an [IndirectObject](../../1-indirectobject/default.md) to the Soup.

An IndirectObject can exist in only one ObjectSoup at a time. If the object supplied is already contained in another ObjectSoup then a Clone of the object is inserted.

When an IndirectObject is inserted the [ID](../../1-indirectobject/2-properties/1-id.md) is updated to reflect the position of the object within the Soup.

## Example

None.
