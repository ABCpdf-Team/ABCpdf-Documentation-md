# SetBitmap Function

Set the content of the object as a Bitmap

## Syntax

[C#]

```csharp
void SetBitmap(System.Drawing.Bitmap bitmap, bool transparent)
```

## Params

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| bitmap | The Bitmap containing the image. |
| transparent | Whether any transparency information should be preserved. |

## Notes

Set the content of the object as a System.Drawing.Bitmap.

If transparency is required, the PixMap must be contained within an [ObjectSoup](2-objectsoup/default.md).

After the Bitmap has been set, the PixMap will be uncompressed. You may wish to compress it using a call like [CompressJpeg](compressjpeg.md) or [CompressFlate](streamobject/1-methods/compressflate.md).
