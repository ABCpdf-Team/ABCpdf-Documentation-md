# SetFile Function

Set the raw binary content of the stream using data from a file.

## Syntax

**[C#]**

```csharp
void SetFile(string path)
```

<span class=language>[Visual
            Basic]</span>  
`Sub SetFile(path As String)``may throw Exception()`

## Params

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| path | A path to a file containing data which should be placed in the StreamObject. | 

## Notes

Set the raw binary content of the stream using data read from a file. If the file cannot be read then an exception is thrown.

Compression settings are unaltered. So if - for example - you have a stream which is Flate compressed you must use SetFile with Flate compressed data.

For this reason you may wish to call [ClearData](cleardata.md) before using SetFile.

## Example

None.
