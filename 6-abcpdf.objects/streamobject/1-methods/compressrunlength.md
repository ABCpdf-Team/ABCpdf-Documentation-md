# CompressRunLength Function

Compress the data in the stream using run length encoding.

## Syntax

**[C#]**

```csharp
bool CompressRunLength()
bool CompressRunLength(bool force)
```

**[Visual Basic]**

```
Sub CompressRunLength() As Boolean
Sub CompressRunLength(force As Boolean) As Boolean
```

## Params

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| force | Whether to force the stream to be compressed in this way. | 
| return | Whether the compression was applied. | 

## Notes

Compress the data in the stream using run length encoding.

Run length encoding is a simple form of compression which replaces sequences of identical bytes, with a count and the value of the bytes in the sequence. While simple to encode and decode, it is relatively inefficient and options such as [CompressFlate](compressflate.md) should be preferred.

PDF streams allow a set of compression filters to be applied to a stream of data. For example one might want to apply Flate compression and then ASCII85 encode the result. This is represented as two compression filters in sequence.

This function does not decompress the stream. So if compression is already present, then this method will compress the already-encoded data and append a compression specification to the sequence.

ABCpdf tries to avoid creating certain compression sequences. Some compression types on some objects are illegal. Some sequences are legal but not supported within Acrobat (though they are in most other viewers). However these are unusual situations and you are unlikely to ever see them.

You can override this behavior by forcing the compression to take place. However if you do this you may end up creating a document which is invalid or unviewable in Acrobat.

## Example
