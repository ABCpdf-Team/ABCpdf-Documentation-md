## Notes

Compression types which result in high levels of compression (e.g. JPEG) are considered more important than those that do not (e.g. ASCII 85).

The CompressionType enumeration may take the following values:

More details of these compression types can be found in Section 3.3 of the Adobe PDF Specification.
