# RadioButtonAnnotation Function

Add radio button annotation to the current page of the doc.

## Syntax

**[C#]**

```csharp
RadioButtonAnnotation(Doc doc, XRect rect, string name, bool selected)
```

<span class=language>[Visual Basic]</span>  

            `RadioButtonAnnotation(Doc doc, XRect rect, string name, bool selected)`
			
## Params

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| doc | Doc | 
| rect | Location for the annotation | 
| name | Name of the annotation | 
| selected | Whether the checkbox should be checked or not | 

## Notes

Add radio button annotation to the current page of the doc.

Note that the annotation created using this constructor is meaningless until it is connected with a [Field](../../field/default.md). For this reason you are likely to want to use [Doc.Form.AddRadioButtonGroup](../../../5-abcpdf/xform/1-methods/addradiobuttongroup.md) rather than this call.

## Example

None.
