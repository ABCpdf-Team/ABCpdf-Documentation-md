# TextSize Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp double ``` [Visual Basic] `Double` | n/a | Yes | The font size used for the text | 

## Notes

The font size used for the text.

This is derived from the [DefaultAppearance](defaultappearance.md) for the field.

Getting this property gets the effective value which may be inherited from a parent field or from document defaults. To change this property use the [SetFont](../1-methods/setfont.md) function.

The value zero has a special significance and indicates that the text in the field should be scaled to fit the area available.

## Example

None.
