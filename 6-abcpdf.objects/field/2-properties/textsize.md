# TextSize Property

## Notes

The font size used for the text.

This is derived from the DefaultAppearance for the field.

Getting this property gets the effective value which may be inherited from a parent field or from document defaults. To change this property use the SetFont function.

The value zero has a special significance and indicates that the text in the field should be scaled to fit the area available.

## Example

None.
