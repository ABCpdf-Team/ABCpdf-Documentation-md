| The font size used for the text. This is derived from the DefaultAppearance for the field. Getting this property gets the effective value which may be inherited from a parent field or from document defaults. To change this property use the SetFont function. The value zero has a special significance and indicates that the text in the field should be scaled to fit the area available. |  |  |
