| The color used for the text. This is derived from the DefaultAppearance for the field. Getting this property gets the effective value which may be inherited. Setting this property sets the value on this item itself. When you set this property a clone of the XColor you assign is created to avoid one XColor being shared by multiple fields. The appearance of the field is not updated until you change the Value or call UpdateAppearance. |  |  |
