# Value Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp string ``` [Visual Basic] `String` | "" | No | The field value. | 

## Notes

This property allows you access to the value of the field.

You may wish to assign or query the form field value using this property.

- Text fields have a free-text value.
- Checkboxes and Radio Buttons have a value which is either "Off" or the on-state of the control as specified in the [Options](options.md).
- Combo Boxes and List Boxes have values restricted to a set of selections as specified in the Options property.
- Pushbuttons and Signatures do not have a value.

Some fields are associated with JavaScript which may be used for validation or formatting. In the case that you assign a value which causes an exception in the JavaScript, that exception will be propagated up the chain and will cause a corresponding C# exception to be raised. If you do not want to run such script, set the [Doc.Form.UseFieldScript](../../../5-abcpdf/xform/2-properties/usefieldscript.md) property to false.

Common Operations.

```

Set a checkbox:

[C#]

```csharp
theField.Value = theField.Options[0];
```

**[Visual Basic]**

```vbnet
theField.Value = theField.Options(0)
```

Clear a checkbox:

[C#]

```csharp

```

**[Visual Basic]**

```

Set the fifth Radio Button in a group:

```

**[Visual Basic]**

```

Multiline Form Fields Tip.

When inserting carriage returns into multiline form fields use carriage returns (\r) only.

Using line feeds (\n) or a carriage return linefeed combination (\r\n) is less compatible with older versions of Acrobat.
