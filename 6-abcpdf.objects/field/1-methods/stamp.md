| Use this method to permanently stamp a field into the document. When this method is called the field appearance is stamped permanently into the document and the field is deleted. The field becomes a new layer on the page (see Doc.LayerCount) so you may wish to call Doc.Flatten on the affected page. You can use the XForm.Stamp method to stamp all fields into the document. |  |  |
