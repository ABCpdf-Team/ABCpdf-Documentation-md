# Insert Function

Inserts a Bookmark into the list at the specified position.

## Syntax

**[C#]**

```csharp
void Insert(int index, Bookmark bookmark)
void Insert(int index, string title)
```

<span class=language>[Visual
            Basic]</span>  

```
Sub Insert(index As Integer, bookmark As Bookmark)
Sub Insert(index As Integer, title As String)

`may throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException()`

## Params

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| index | The zero-based index at which value should be inserted. | 
| bookmark | The bookmark to be added. | 
| title | The title for the bookmark to be added. | 

## Notes

Inserts an item into the list at the specified position.

You can insert a Bookmark directly or you can use one of the overloaded operators to insert a bookmark with a specified title.

When you insert a string this is encapsulated within a new Bookmark which is then inserted.

Bookmarks can exist in only one place at a time. If the Bookmark supplied is already contained by another object then a [Clone](../../1-indirectobject/1-methods/4-clone.md) of the Bookmark is added.

If the index equals the number of items in the array then the bookmark is appended to the end.

If the index is not a valid index this method throws an ArgumentOutOfRangeException.

## Example

None.
