Adds a Bookmark to the end of the list.

## Syntax

```

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| bookmark | The bookmark to be added. |
| title | The title for the bookmark to be added. |

## Notes

This method adds an item to the end of the list.

You can add a Bookmark directly or you can use one of the overloaded operators to add a bookmark with a specified title.

When you add a string this is encapsulated within a new Bookmark which is then inserted.

Bookmarks can exist in only one place at a time. If the Bookmark supplied is already contained by another object then a [Clone](1-indirectobject/1-methods/4-clone.md) of the Bookmark is added.
