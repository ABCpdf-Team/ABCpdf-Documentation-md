# GetNamedSeparations Function

Gets all the named separations referenced by the page.

## Syntax

string[] GetNamedSeparations()
```

**[Visual Basic]**

`Function GetNamedSeparations() As String()`
## Params

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- |

## Notes

Gets the names of all the separations referenced by the page.

In general named separations (ink names) are referenced on a page because they are used on that page.

However this is not a necessary truth. A spot color separation can be referenced but never used.
