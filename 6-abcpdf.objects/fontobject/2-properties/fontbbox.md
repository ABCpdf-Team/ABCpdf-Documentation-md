# FontBBox Property

## Notes

The bounding box for the glyphs in this font. This XRect corresponds to the xMin, xMax, yMin and yMax entries in the 'head' TrueType table. The PDF format only supports a limited range of metrics so FontObjects read from PDF may contain some approximations compared with 'live' FontObjects which have been added using the Doc.AddFont or Doc.EmbedFont methods.

## Example

None.
