# EncodeText Function

Encode text for use with PDF text operators.

## Syntax

**[C#]**

```csharp
string EncodeText(string text, EncodingSupport support)
string EncodeText(string text, EncodingSupport support, out int outCount)
```

<span class=language>[Visual
            Basic]</span>  

```
Function EncodeText(text As String, support As EncodingSupport)
Function EncodeText(text As String, support As EncodingSupport,  ByRef outCount As Integer)
```

</p>`may throw Exception()` ## Params | Name | Description | | --- | --- | | text | The text to be encoded. | | support | The way in which characters not included in the font are to be encoded. | | outCount | The number of characters in (parameter) text that are encoded in the return value. | | return | The PDF string containing the encoded text. | ## Notes Use this method to convert Unicode text into PDF string for use with the Tj or the TJ operator.

The EncodingSupport enumeration can take any of the following values:

- All – encode all text.
- NoneIfAnyNotSupported – encode nothing if any character is not included in the font.
- SupportedPrefix – encode up to and excluding the first character not included in the font.

Note that the encoding for a font is constructed and cached at the time the font is first created. So changing the encoding for the font will not result in a corresponding change of behavior from this method. If this is something you need to do then you will need to create an entirely new font.

## Example

None.
