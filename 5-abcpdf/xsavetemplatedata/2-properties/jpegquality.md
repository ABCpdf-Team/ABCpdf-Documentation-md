# JpegQuality Property

## Notes

This property specifies the quality level when encoding images in JPEG. The value ranges from 0 (the worst quality, smaller output) to 100 (the best quality, larger output). Setting the property to -1 is considered as not specifying the quality level, and an appropriate default quality level is used.

## Example

None.
