| The baseline of the font in thousandths of a unit. To find the base of the font use this metric together with the font size to find the distance from the top of the text area to the baseline of your font. For example if the baseline is 800 and the font size is 100 points, then the base of the font will be 80 points from the top of the current rectangle. |  |  |
