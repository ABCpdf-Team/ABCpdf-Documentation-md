# Widths Property

## Notes

The character widths for all the characters in the font.

The array is indexable by Unicode value. For example to find the width of a space (ASCII 32) you would simply reference item 32 in the array.

The values are measured in in 1000ths of a PDF unit. Characters with no representation in the font are assigned a width of -1.

## Example

None.
