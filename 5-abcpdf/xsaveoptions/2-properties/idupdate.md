| **[C#]** ```csharp bool ``` [Visual Basic] `Boolean` | true | No | Whether to update the file version identifier. | 

## Notes

This property determines if the file version identifier should be updated.

PDF documents have two unique file identifiers. One is a file specific identifier which stays constant throughout the life of the file. The other is a file version identifier which is updated every time the document is saved.

This property allows you to suppress the version update.
