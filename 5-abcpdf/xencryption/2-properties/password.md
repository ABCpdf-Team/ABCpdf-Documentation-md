# Password Property

## Notes

This property determines or reflects the user password for the document.

You can open and view an encrypted document with either the user or the owner password. However only the owner has full control over the document. The user may have a restricted set of permissions.

Typically the user password is left blank to allow all users to view the document.

For more information about the user and owner passwords see the Doc.Encryption property.

## Example

See the Doc.Encryption property.
