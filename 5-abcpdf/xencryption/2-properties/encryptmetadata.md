# EncryptMetadata Property

## Notes

This property determines whether the document metadata is encrypted. It is in effect only when Type is 4 or above.

The document metadata can be saved unencrypted so that tools that do not support PDF encryption can still index/process the document using the metadata.

## Example

None.
