# Operation Property

| **Type** | **Default** | **Read Only** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | null | No | Gets or sets the Operation to use. |

## Notes

This property is used by modules for which a suitable derived class of [Operation](8-abcpdf.operations/1-operation/default.md) exists. If it is null, those modules create a temporary [Operation](8-abcpdf.operations/1-operation/default.md) with default behaviours.

## Example
