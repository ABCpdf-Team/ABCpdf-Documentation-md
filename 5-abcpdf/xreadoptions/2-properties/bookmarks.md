| The BookmarkType enumeration may take any of the following values: DontCare – specifies that module-specific default settings should be used. None – specifies that no bookmarks should be imported from source documents. Heading – specifies that bookmarks should be created using document headings. For example, styled headings in Microsoft Word might be used. This property is currently used only when importing MS Word-supported documents using the MSOffice read module. |  |  |
