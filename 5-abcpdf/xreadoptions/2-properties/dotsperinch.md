| The default resolution to use for the import. Some file formats allows you to specify pixel based measurements which can only be converted to physical measurements in the context of a resolution. However some formats do not require a resolution to be specified and so a default may need to be supplied. This property is currently only used for the import of SVG documents. |  |  |
