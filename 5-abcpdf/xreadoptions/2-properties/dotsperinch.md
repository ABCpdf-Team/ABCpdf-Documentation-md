## Notes

The default resolution to use for the import.

Some file formats allows you to specify pixel based measurements which can only be converted to physical measurements in the context of a resolution. However some formats do not require a resolution to be specified and so a default may need to be supplied.

This property is currently only used for the import of SVG documents.
