## Notes

This property is used by the OpenOffice.org import module. It is used to pass custom parameters to OpenOffice.org for precise control over the PDF conversion process.

The parameters are a set of named objects. The names and object types vary between versions of OpenOffice.org but ABCpdf defaults to a base set that is appropriate for most conversions.

More details and other options can be found on the OpenOffice.org web site.
