# Red Property

## Notes

Allows you to get or set the red component.

RGB color components can range from 0 to 255.

Querying this property does not change the ColorSpace. This means you can obtain approximate RGB values for CMYK or Grayscale colors.

However if you change the value of this property the color will automatically be converted to RGB.

## Example

None.
