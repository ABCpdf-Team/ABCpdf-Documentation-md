## Notes

Allows you to get or set the magenta level.

CMYK color components can range from 0 to 100.

Querying this property does not change the [ColorSpace](colorspace.md). This means you can obtain approximate CMYK values for RGB or Grayscale colors.

However if you change the value of this property the color will automatically be converted to CMYK.

## Example

None.
