# Black Property

## Notes

Allows you to get or set the black level.

CMYK color components can range from 0 to 100.

Querying this property does not change the ColorSpace. This means you can obtain approximate CMYK values for RGB or Grayscale colors.

However if you change the value of this property the color will automatically be converted to CMYK.

## Example

None.
