```

## Params

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| value1 | The intensity of the first component (typically 0 to 1) | 
| value2 | The intensity of the second component (typically 0 to 1) | 
| value3 | The intensity of the third component (typically 0 to 1) | 
| value4 | The intensity of the fourth component (typically 0 to 1) | 

## Notes

Sets the color to the generic [ColorSpace](../2-properties/colorspace.md) color space and provide a set of components for it.

PDF color components typically range between zero - no intensity - and one - 100% intensity. However this is not always the case. For color spaces such as Lab the components may take a wider range of values.
