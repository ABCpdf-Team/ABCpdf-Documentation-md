## Notes

Create an XColor from a set of PDF components in the generic [ColorSpace](2-properties/colorspace.md) color space.

PDF color components typically range between zero - no intensity - and one - 100% intensity. However this is not always the case. For color spaces such as Lab the components may take a wider range of values.
