| Whether FireShield is enabled. Even when the Policy is None FireShield is still loaded and enabled to allow rules to be changed without having to restart worker processes. This property allows you to entirely disable FireShield. However in general you should prefer to simply set the Policy and leave FireShield enabled. |  |  |
