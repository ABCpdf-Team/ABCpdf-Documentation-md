|  |  |  | 
| The FireShield settings that dynamically determine the file access that should be allowed for HTML conversion. FireShield lets you dynamically assign file permissions at runtime, to ensure that your HTML engine only accesses the locations you want. You can provide rules so that each request can be assigned custom rights and permissions, dependent on the type of conversion. ``` System.Object WebSupergoo.ABCpdf13.XHtmlFireShield ``` |  |  |
