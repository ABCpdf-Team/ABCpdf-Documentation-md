```

## Params

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| name | The fully qualified name of the field. |
| return | The matching field. |

## Notes

Use this method to retrieve a field referenced by fully qualified name.

If no matching field can be found then a null value will be returned.

When setting a value any intermediate fields will be created and the provided field name will be updated to reflect the field path provided.

In C# this property is the indexer for the class.
