# Fields Property

## Notes

The collection of all top level fields in the form.

Items in this collection can be referenced by partial field name or by zero based index.

As with all collections you can use the Count property to determine the number of items contained and you can iterate through the collection using the standard methods appropriate to the language you are coding in.

## Example

None.
