# Pattern Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp string ``` [Visual Basic] `string` | null | No | A pattern specifying a path that that should be the target of control. | 

## Notes

A pattern specifying a path that that should be the target of control.

These patterns are specified using DOS glob format. However the pattern matching is generic so a wildcard can match against path separators like backslash characters as well as normal characters.

For example to match on Windows DLLs you might specify "C:\Windows\System32\*.dll".

## Example

None.
