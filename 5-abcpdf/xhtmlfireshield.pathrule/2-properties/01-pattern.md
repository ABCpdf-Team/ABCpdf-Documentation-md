| A pattern specifying a path that that should be the target of control. These patterns are specified using DOS glob format. However the pattern matching is generic so a wildcard can match against path separators like backslash characters as well as normal characters. For example to match on Windows DLLs you might specify "C:\Windows\System32\*.dll". |  |  |
