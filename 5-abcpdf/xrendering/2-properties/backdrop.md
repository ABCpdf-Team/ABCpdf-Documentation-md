# Backdrop Property

## Notes

The background color against which content is rendered.

By default the backdrop color is white which mimics printing on white paper.

However you can change this if you wanted, for example, to mimic printing on pink paper.

The color you supply will be converted to the rendering color space.

## Example

None.
