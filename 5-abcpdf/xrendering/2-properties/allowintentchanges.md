# AllowIntentChanges Property

| **Type** | **Default** | **Read Only** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | true | No | Whether content in the PDF is allowed to override the rendering intent. |

## Notes

The default rendering intent for the operation is determined by the [RenderingIntent](renderingintent.md) property.

However the rendering intent is part of the PDF graphics state and as such, operators in the page content stream may sometimes set it to a different value.

This property allows you to decide whether you will allow this type of change or whether it should be ignored.

## Example

None
