| This property determines the vertical resolution of the output image. Because PDF documents specify distances in physical units (typically points) a resolution unit is needed to convert these physical units to pixel based units. For example a document 612 points high rendered at 144 DPI will result in an output image 1224 pixels high. |  |  |
