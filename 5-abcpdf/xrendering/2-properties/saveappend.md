# SaveAppend Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp bool ``` [Visual Basic] `Boolean` | false | No | Whether to append to (rather than overwrite) existing image files. | 

## Notes

This property determines whether the Save method appends to (rather than overwrites) existing image files.

If this property is set to true and a file already exists then the Save method appends the rendered image to the exisiing file rather than just overwriting it. In this way you can build up multi-page images.

For in-memory operations you can use this property set to true in conjunction with a MemoryStream and the Save overload that supports streams.

This property is used for TIFF output only.

## Example

See the [SaveCompression](savecompression.md) property.
