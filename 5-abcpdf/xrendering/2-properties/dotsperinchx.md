# DotsPerInchX Property

## Notes

This property determines the horizontal resolution of the output image.

Because PDF documents specify distances in physical units (typically points) a resolution unit is needed to convert these physical units to pixel based units.

For example a document 612 points wide rendered at 144 DPI will result in an output image 1224 pixels wide.

## Example

See the SaveCompression property.
