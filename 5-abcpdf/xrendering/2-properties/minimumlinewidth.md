# MinimumLineWidth Property

## Notes

The minimum stroked line width for output.

This represents the minimum line width for stroked objects in device units (typically pixels). Lines that are narrower than this are set to this minimum line width. This can be used to ensure that narrow lines will still be visible even when drawn on high resolution outputs.

## Example

None.
