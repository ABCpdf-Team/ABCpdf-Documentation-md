# Dither Property

## Notes

Whether to dither colors when mapping to the palette.

When images are exported at a reduced color depth, they can be dithered.

Dithering uses a scattering of pixels of different colors to approximate colors that are not available.

In general it is a good idea to dither images like photographs which contain smooth gradations of colors.

It is best not to dither posterized images containing blocks of colors.

## Example

None.
