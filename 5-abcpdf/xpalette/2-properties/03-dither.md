| Whether to dither colors when mapping to the palette. When images are exported at a reduced color depth, they can be dithered. Dithering uses a scattering of pixels of different colors to approximate colors that are not available. In general it is a good idea to dither images like photographs which contain smooth gradations of colors. It is best not to dither posterized images containing blocks of colors. |  |  |
