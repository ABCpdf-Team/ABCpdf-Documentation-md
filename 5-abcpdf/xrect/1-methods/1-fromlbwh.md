## Notes

This method constructs an XRect object from a bottom left corner, a width and a height.

It assumes that subsequent resizing and positioning operations on this object will also be based around the bottom left corner. As such the [Pin](2-properties/pin.md) property will remain at its default of Corner.BottomLeft.
