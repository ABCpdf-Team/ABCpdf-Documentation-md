# FromAtom  Function

Create an XRect from a standard PDF Rectangle ArrayAtom.

## Syntax

[C#]

```csharp
static <a href="../default.htm">XRect</a> FromAtom(<a href="../../../6-abcpdf.objects/1-indirectobject/default.htm">IndirectObject</a> io, <a href="../../../7-abcpdf.atoms/arrayatom/default.htm">ArrayAtom</a> array)
```

## Params

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| io | Any IndirectObject from the document. |
| array | An ArrayAtom containing four NumAtoms. |
| return | The newly created XRect object. |

## Notes

Create an XRect from a standard PDF Rectangle ArrayAtom.

Such arrays typically contain four numbers - lower left x and y coordinates followed by upper right x and y.

However this is a convention and any two diagonally opposite points are acceptable.

If the array is null or the entries do not resolve to four NumAtoms then the return value will be null.

## Example
