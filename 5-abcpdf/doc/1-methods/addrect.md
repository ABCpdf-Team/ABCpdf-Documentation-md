# AddRect Function

Add a rectangle to the current page.

## Syntax

[C#]

```csharp
int AddRect(bool filled)
```

[Visual Basic]

```vb
Function AddRect(filled As Boolean) As Integer
```

## Params

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| filled | Whether to fill the rectangle rather than simply outline it. |
| return | The Object ID of the newly added Graphic Object. |

## Notes

Add a rectangle drawn in the current [color](2-properties/color.md) at the current [width](2-properties/width.md) and with the current [options](2-properties/options.md). The rectangle may be outlined or filled.

Note that this is subtly different from the way that FrameRect works. When a rectangle is framed the line goes around the outside of the rectangle. When a rectangle is added the line is centered on the rectangle - so half is inside and half is outside.

## Example

None
