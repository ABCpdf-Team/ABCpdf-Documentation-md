# AddColorSpaceSpot Function

Adds a separation color space to the document.

## Syntax

[C#]

```csharp
int AddColorSpaceSpot(string name, string color)
```

## Params

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| name | The name of the color. |
| color | The display representation of the color. This should be supplied in the same format as the XColor.String uses. |
| return | The Object ID of the newly added ColorSpace Object. |

## Notes

Adds a separation color space to the document returning the ID of the newly added object.

Separation color spaces allow you to add spot colors or isolate the use of individual colorants. A separation color space represents a particular colorant and allows you to specify the amount of that colorant that is applied.

For example you might define a separation color space called Gold with a display representation of CMYK yellow. You might then draw some text with different amounts of Gold. When viewing the output on a standard monitor the display representation of the color would be used. However when printed - using appropriate software and an appropriate printer - the name of the color might be used to select a gold colored ink.

The current color space is defined by the [ColorSpace](2-properties/colorspace.md) property. The current color is defined by the [Color](2-properties/color.md) property. Because separations represent a single value property you should use single component - grayscale - colors to specify the amount of spot colorant to use.

There are two special color spaces:

'All' refers collectively to all colorants on an output device. It can be useful for printing registration marks.

'None' indicates no colorant and will never produce any visible output.

## Example

In this example we define a colorant called Gold and add some text using varying amounts of our colorant.

[C#]

```csharp
using var doc = new Doc();
doc.Rect.Inset(20, 20);
doc.FontSize = 300;
doc.ColorSpace = doc.AddColorSpaceSpot("GOLD", "0 0 100 0");
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  doc.Color.Gray = 255 / i;
  doc.AddText(doc.Color.Gray.ToString());
  doc.Rect.Move(25, -50);
}
doc.Save("docaddcolorspacespot.pdf");
```
