* Didots (Didot Points) - 1/72 of a French Royal Inch
* ATAPoints (ATA Points) - 1/72.272 of an Inch

### Why are my Units a string?

In older versions of ABCpdf the Units property was a string. So you might find code of this form.

[C#]

```csharp
theDoc.Units = "mm";
```

In Version 8 the Units property has been changed to a true enumeration. This is a safer way of coding as it allows the compiler to ensure that the values you are using are valid. Your new code should look like this.

The names of the items in the UnitType enumeration are the same as the values of the strings used in previous versions. So changing your code should be a simple search and replace operation.

Alternatively if you need to convert between enumerations and strings automatically you can do so. To convert from a string to an enumeration use the following code.

[C#]

```csharp
UnitType unitType = (UnitType)Enum.Parse(typeof(UnitType), unitString, true);
```

To convert from an enumeration to a string use the following code.

[C#]

```csharp
string unitString = unitType.ToString("G");
```
