| This property allows you to examine and manipulate the document Form and Fields. Fields are generally obtained using a fully qualified name. A full name describes a path down through the field hierarchy - using periods as delimiters - to a specific field object. Once a field has been obtained you can query or change its values. If you wish to convert the fields into a permanent part of the document you can use the Field.Stamp method to permanently emboss them. See the XForm object for full details. |  |  |
