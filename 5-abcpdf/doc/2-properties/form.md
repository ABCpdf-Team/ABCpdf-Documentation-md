# Form Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp XForm ``` [Visual Basic] `XForm` | n/a | No | The document form and fields. | 

## Notes

This property allows you to examine and manipulate the document Form and Fields.

Fields are generally obtained using a fully qualified name. A full name describes a path down through the field hierarchy - using periods as delimiters - to a specific field object.

Once a field has been obtained you can query or change its values. If you wish to convert the fields into a permanent part of the document you can use the [Field.Stamp](../../../6-abcpdf.objects/field/1-methods/stamp.md) method to permanently emboss them.

See the XForm object for full details.
