# PageCachePurge Method

Purges the HTML page cache.

## Syntax

**[C#]**

```csharp
void PageCachePurge()
```

<span class=language>[Visual
            Basic]</span>  
`Sub PageCachePurge()`
## Params

| Name | Description |

| return | n/a. | 

## Notes

ABCpdf holds a cache of recently requested URLs and it's only after five minutes or so that these pages expire from the cache.

This results in a considerable degree of optimization for many common operations.

You can clear the cache of all expired pages by calling this method.

## Example

None.
