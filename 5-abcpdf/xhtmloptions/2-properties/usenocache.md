# UseNoCache Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp bool ``` [Visual Basic] `Boolean` | false | No | Whether any proxy servers should re-request items of content. | 

## Notes

This property determines whether no-cache is enabled.

Setting this property to true forces any intervening proxy server to re-request the page.

For the [MSHTML engine](1-engine.md), setting this property to true sets INTERNET_FLAG_PRAGMA_NOCACHE. WinINET will add request header Pragma: no-cache if going through a HTTP/1.0 proxy and request header Cache-Control: no-cache if going through a HTTP/1.1 proxy.

For the [Gecko engine](1-engine.md), setting this property to true sets the following flags.

- LOAD_FLAGS_IS_REFRESH — the load should have the semantics of an HTML Meta-refresh tag (i.e., that the cache should be bypassed).
- LOAD_FLAGS_BYPASS_HISTORY — history should not be updated.
- LOAD_FLAGS_BYPASS_CACHE — the local web cache should be bypassed (but an intermediate proxy cache could still be used to satisfy the load).
- LOAD_FLAGS_BYPASS_PROXY — any intermediate proxy caches should be bypassed (i.e., that the content should be loaded from the origin server).

## Example

None.
