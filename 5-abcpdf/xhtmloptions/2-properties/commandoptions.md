# CommandOptions Property

## Notes

A set of command options for the HTML engine.

For example the ABCChrome engine accepts a "lang" option to allow you to set the default locale. You can provide strings like "en-GB" or "es".

Options are engine specific and low level so you will need to investigate to find out what may be available.

## Example

None.
