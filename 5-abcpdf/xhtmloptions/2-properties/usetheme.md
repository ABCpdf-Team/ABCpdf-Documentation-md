# UseTheme Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp bool ``` [Visual Basic] `Boolean` | false | Yes | Whether to use themes. | 

## Notes

This property determines whether UI theme is applied to controls.

The theme is only relevant if you are using the MSHTML engine for IE9 or earlier. As such it is likely that this function will be deprecated in future releases of ABCpdf.

To change the value, use [SetTheme](../1-methods/settheme.md).

## Example

None.
