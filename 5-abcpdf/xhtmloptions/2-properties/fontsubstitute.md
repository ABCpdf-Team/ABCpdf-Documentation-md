# FontSubstitute Property

## Notes

This property determines whether font substitution is enabled.

In many situations default built-in fonts can be substituted in place of the specified fonts.

This can result in a substantial increase in speed and a considerable reduction in file size with little or no loss in output quality.

## Example

None.
