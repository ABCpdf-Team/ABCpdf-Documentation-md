| Whether hyperlinks with targets should be allowed to open in a new browser window. In HTML, hyperlinks whose targets are neither empty, "_self", "_parent", nor "_top" will be opened in new browser window. Setting this property to true allows you to mimic this behavior when the PDF document is viewed inside a browser. |  |  |
