| This property determines whether fonts are embedded. HTML rendering may require that fonts are added to the PDF document. By default these fonts are - where possible - referenced. You can use this setting to ensure that fonts are embedded. This will increase output fidelity at a cost of processing time and output file size. |  |  |
