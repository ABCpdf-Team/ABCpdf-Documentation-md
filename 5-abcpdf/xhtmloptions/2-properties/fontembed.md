# FontEmbed Property

## Notes

This property determines whether fonts are embedded.

HTML rendering may require that fonts are added to the PDF document.

By default these fonts are - where possible - referenced. You can use this setting to ensure that fonts are embedded. This will increase output fidelity at a cost of processing time and output file size.

## Example

None.
