# BoundingBox Property

## Notes

This property reflects the physical bounds of the image.

It is more relevant for EPS and PS files which operate in terms of physical dimensions rather than pixels.

Note that EPS and PS files may have bounds which are not anchored at the origin.

## Example

None.
