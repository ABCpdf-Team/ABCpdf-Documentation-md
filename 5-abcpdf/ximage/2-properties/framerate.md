# FrameRate Property

## Notes

Some formats like Flash consist of a sequence of frames to be played one after the other.

This property tells you the number of frames per second that should be played. Note that this is an indicative property - it indicates a desired value. If movies are complicated then some devices on which they are played may not be able to achieve the desired frame rates.

## Example

See the Frame property.
