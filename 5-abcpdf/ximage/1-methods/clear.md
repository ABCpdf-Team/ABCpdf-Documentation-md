# Clear Function

Clears the image.

## Syntax

[C#]

```csharp
void Clear()void Clear(out <a href="../../xreadoptions/default.htm">XReadOptions</a> outOptions, out Stream outStream)
```

## Params

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| outOptions | The XReadOptions used to create the object. |
| outStream | The Stream used to create the object if NeedsStream is true. |

## Notes

Use this method to release resources and return the image to a just-created state.

The overload without parameters disposes of the [XReadOptions](xreadoptions/default.md) and of the Stream.

The overload with output parameters returns the [XReadOptions](xreadoptions/default.md) and the Stream. The returned objects have not been disposed of.
