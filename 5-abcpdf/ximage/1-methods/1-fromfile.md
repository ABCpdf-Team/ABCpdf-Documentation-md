# FromFile Function

Creates an XImage from a file path.

## Syntax

**[C#]**

```csharp
static XImage FromFile(string path, XReadOptions options)
```

<span class=language>[Visual Basic]</span>  
`Shared Function FromFile(path As String, options As XReadOptions) As XImage``may throw Exception()`

## Params

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| path | The path to the graphic file. | 
| options | The settings for the read. The XImage takes ownership of this parameter. This may be null. | 
| return | The resulting IndirectObject. | 

## Notes

The file will typically be one of the following types: JPEG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, PNG, PSD, PDB, EXIF, WMF, EMF, EPS, PS or SWF (Flash).

For details of additional formats which are supported and the way they are imported, see the [ReadModule](../../xreadoptions/2-properties/1-readmodule.md) property and the the [Doc.Read](../../doc/1-methods/read.md) method.

The advantage of this method over [SetFile](setfile.md), is that you can specify the [ReadModule](../../xreadoptions/2-properties/1-readmodule.md) you would like to use. This allows precise control over the way that your graphics are imported.

In addition you can also control the way that transparency is treated using the [PreserveTransparency](../../xreadoptions/2-properties/preservetransparency.md) property.

The object takes the ownership of the XReadOptions, which is disposed of when the object is disposed of. You can make the object release the ownership without disposing of the XReadOptions using the parameterized overloads of [Dispose](4-dispose.md) and [Clear](clear.md). The XReadOptions must not be modified as long as the object has the ownership.

If the returned XImage has the [NeedsFile](../2-properties/needsfile.md) property set to true, you must ensure that the specified file will remain present and unmodified until the XImage object is cleared, disposed of, or garbage-collected.

## Example

None.
