# SetStream Function

Load an image from stream.

## Syntax

[C#]

```csharp
void SetStream(Stream stream)
```

## Params

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Stream | The stream containing the graphic. |

## Notes

Load an image from stream.

The stream can contain any of the following types: JPEG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, PNG, PSD, PDB, EXIF, WMF, EMF, EPS, PS or SWF (Flash).

Ultimately each import goes through a [ReadModule](xreadoptions/2-properties/1-readmodule.md) so for details of additional formats supported and the way they are imported, see the [ReadModule](xreadoptions/2-properties/1-readmodule.md) property.

Different images within the file can be accessed using the [Frame](2-properties/frame.md) property. Different portions of the image can be selected using the [Selection](2-properties/selection.md) property.

## Example

Here we read a TIFF file and present the data to the XImage object. We then add the image to our document and then save the PDF.

[C#]

```csharp
using var img = new XImage();
string path = "../mypics/mypic.jpg";
using var stream = File.OpenRead(path);
img.SetStream(stream);
using var doc = new Doc();
doc.Rect.Inset(20, 20);
doc.AddImageObject(img, false);
doc.Save("imagesetstream.pdf");
```
