| This setting allows you to accommodate bi-directional languages such as Hebrew and Arabic. In general the text operation assumes that text will be laid out in a left-to-right manner. By changing this property you can allow text to be grouped in both a left-to-right and right-to-left direction. The value you provide indicates the default starting direction for bi-directional text within the document. |  |  |
