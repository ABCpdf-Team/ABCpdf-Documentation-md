# Direction  Property

| **Type** | **Default** | **Read Only** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [C#] <BR> `XTextStyle.DirectionType` | DirectionType.Default | No | The default direction for text. |

## Notes

This setting allows you to accommodate bi-directional languages such as Hebrew and Arabic.

In general the text operation assumes that text will be laid out in a left-to-right manner. By changing this property you can allow text to be grouped in both a left-to-right and right-to-left direction.

The value you provide indicates the default starting direction for bi-directional text within the document.
