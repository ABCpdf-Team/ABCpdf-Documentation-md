# AngleRounding Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp int ``` [Visual Basic] `Integer` | 0 | No | In the case that text is drawn at an angle, this property allows a snap-to-fit effect. | 

## Notes

In the case that text is drawn at an angle, this property allows a snap-to-fit effect.

So if the value was 20 degrees, then text at an angle of 9 degrees would be drawn completely level.

The default snap is 10 degrees.

## Example

None.
