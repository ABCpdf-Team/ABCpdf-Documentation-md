# FindLists Property

| **Type** | **Default** | **Read Only** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | false | No | Whether to detect and insert ordered and unordered list structures. |

## Notes

Whether to detect and insert ordered and unordered list structures.

Much as in HTML, tagged PDF documents support list tags. If this property is set to true, the AccessibilityOperation will attempt to detect list structures and add appropriate tags.

## Example
