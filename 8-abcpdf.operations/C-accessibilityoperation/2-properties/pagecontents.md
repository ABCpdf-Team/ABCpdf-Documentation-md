# PageContents Property

| Type | Default | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp PageContents ``` [Visual Basic] `PageContents` | n/a | No | The pages to be operated upon. | 

## Notes

This property specifies the pages to be operated upon.

Adding pages to a PageContents object can be a costly procedure taking a noticable amount of time.

So if you are performing a set of analysis operations on the same pages it can be more efficient to assign the PageContents from one to another rather than repeatedly re-populate from the original document.

## Example

Also see example code in: [AccessibilityOperation AccessibilityOperation Constructor](../1-methods/1-accessibilityoperation.md).
