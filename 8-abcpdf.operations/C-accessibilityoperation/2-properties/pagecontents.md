| This property specifies the pages to be operated upon. Adding pages to a PageContents object can be a costly procedure taking a noticable amount of time. So if you are performing a set of analysis operations on the same pages it can be more efficient to assign the PageContents from one to another rather than repeatedly re-populate from the original document. |  |  |
