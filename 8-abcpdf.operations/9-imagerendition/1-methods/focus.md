| Focus the document on the location of the image placement. After calling this function you can add content overlaying the image rendition. For example you might call Doc.FrameRect to frame it. Because images are always drawn using a transformation matrix rather than a Rect you will probably need to reduce the size of any lines or text to values smaller than one. |  |  |
