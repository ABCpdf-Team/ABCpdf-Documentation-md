# ReadUrl Function

Read a URL into a paged PDF document.

## Syntax

[C#]

```csharp
ReadUrl(string url)
```

[Visual Basic]

```vb
ReadUrl(url As String)
```

## Params

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| url | The URL to read. |

## Notes

Read a URL into a paged PDF document.

On return all [Doc](2-properties/01-doc.md) properties are reset to default values.

This method works in a similar way to [Doc.AddImageUrl](/Manual/5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/addimageurl.md) and so it is worth reading the notes for that function.
