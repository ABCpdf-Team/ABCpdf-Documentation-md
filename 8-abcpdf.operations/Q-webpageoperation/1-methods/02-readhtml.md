# ReadHtml Function

Read a string of HTML into a paged PDF document.

## Syntax

**[C#]**

```csharp
ReadHtml(string html)
```

<span class=language>[Visual Basic]</span>  

            `ReadHtml(html As String)`
			
## Params

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| html | The HTML to read. | 

## Notes

Read a string of HTML into a paged PDF document.

On return all [Doc](../2-properties/01-doc.md) properties are reset to default values.

This method works in a similar way to [Doc.AddImageHtml](/Manual/5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/addimagehtml.md) and so it is worth reading the notes here, especially as relates to very large HTML strings.

## Example

None.
