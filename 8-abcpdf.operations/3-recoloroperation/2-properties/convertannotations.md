# ConvertAnnotations Property

| Type | Default | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp bool ``` [Visual Basic]`Boolean` | true | No | Gets or sets a value indicating whether annotations are to be recolored. | 

## Notes

Whether annotations should be recolored.

Annotations and fields are not part of the page but instead float over the page. You can choose whether to convert the appearance stream of any annotations or leave them in their native color space.

## Example

See the [Recolor](../1-methods/recolor.md) method.

Also see example code in: [RecolorOperation Recolor Function](../1-methods/recolor.md).
