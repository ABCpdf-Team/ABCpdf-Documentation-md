# PageNumber Property

| **Type** | **Default** | **Read Only** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [C#] <BR> `int?` | n/a | No | Gets or sets the page number of the source page being/to be processed. |

## Notes

The value of this property when the [Operation.ProcessingObject](1-operation/3-events/1-processingobject.md) event is generated depends on the operation.

The event handler should change this value when a processing sequence other than the default is desired. Set this value to null to end the processing of the current set of pages.

## Example

Also see example code in: [XpsImportOperation Import Function](4-xpsimportoperation/1-methods/import.md).
