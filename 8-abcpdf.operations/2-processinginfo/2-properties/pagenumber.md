# PageNumber Property

| Type | Default | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp int? ``` [Visual Basic]`Nullable(Of Integer)` | n/a | No | Gets or sets the page number of the source page being/to be processed. | 

## Notes

The value of this property when the [Operation.ProcessingObject](../../1-operation/3-events/1-processingobject.md) event is generated depends on the operation.

The event handler should change this value when a processing sequence other than the default is desired. Set this value to null to end the processing of the current set of pages.

## Example

See the [XpsImportOperation.Import](../../4-xpsimportoperation/1-methods/import.md) method.

Also see example code in: [XpsImportOperation Import Function](../../4-xpsimportoperation/1-methods/import.md).
