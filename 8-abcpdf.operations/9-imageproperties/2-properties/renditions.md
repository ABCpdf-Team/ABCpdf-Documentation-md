# Renditions Property

| Type | Default | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp IListImageRendition> ``` [Visual Basic] `IListImageRendition>` | n/a | Yes | The set of renditions of the image at different locations within the document. | 

## Notes

The set of renditions of the image at different locations within the document.

Much like HTML, PDF allows a divorce between the image and the placement of that image. So you may have one bitmap which is drawn multiple times at multiple sizes in different locations within the document.

## Example

None.
