# GetStream Function

Get the conforming document as raw data stream.

## Syntax

[C#]

```csharp
Stream GetStream(Doc doc)
```

[Visual Basic]

```vb
Function GetStream(doc As Doc) As Stream
```

## Params

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| doc | The document. |
| return | The PDF document as a stream. |

## Notes

The method writes the document in a conforming PDF format according to the [Conformance](2-properties/conformance.md) property. Any conformance error is reported in the [Errors](2-properties/errors.md) property after the method finishes.

Because of the CLR limit of 2 GB per object, the [GetData](getdata.md) method cannot return the data for a document larger than 2 GB. Use this method for documents larger than 2 GB. Dispose of the returned stream as soon as it is no longer needed for small memory footprint.

## Example
