| The current text state. Text state is not saved and restored using the PDF save and restore operators. Text state operators can occur anywhere in a content stream but typically they only occur within text blocks. A text block initializes a text matrix which allows text positioning and text showing. At the end of the text block the matrix is discarded. |  |  |
