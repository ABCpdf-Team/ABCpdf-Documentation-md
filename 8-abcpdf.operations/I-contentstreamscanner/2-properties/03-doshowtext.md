# DoShowText Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp bool ``` [Visual Basic] `Boolean` | false | No | Whether to call into the ShowText function. | 

## Notes

Whether to call into the [ShowText](../1-methods/04-showtext.md) function.

Overriding the [ShowText](../1-methods/04-showtext.md) function allows you to get the content and position of text.

However this is quite computationally expensive so if you do not need it then you can disable this feature.

## Example

None.
