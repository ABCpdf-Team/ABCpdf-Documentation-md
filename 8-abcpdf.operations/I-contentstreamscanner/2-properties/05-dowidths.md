# DoWidths Property

## Notes

Whether to calcuate text widths or not.

If this property is true then the ShowText function will be passed the character and advance widths for text. If it is false then null will be passed.

This is quite computationally expensive so if you do not need to know the current text position on the line then you can disable this feature.

## Example

None.
