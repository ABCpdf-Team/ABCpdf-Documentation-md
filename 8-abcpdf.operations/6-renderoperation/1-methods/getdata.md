## Notes

Renders a page into an array of bytes.

The page and rendering options which will be used are those which were current at the time the RenderOperation was created.

This method is similar in functionality to [XRendering.GetBitmap](../../../5-abcpdf/xrendering/1-methods/getbitmap.md) but allows safe muti-threaded use.

For details see the [Save](save.md) method.
