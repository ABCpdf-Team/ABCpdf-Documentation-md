The text of the drawing operator.

Each TextFragment spans a part of a PDF stream drawing operator. The part may be the entire of the text drawn by the operator or it may be a section of the text within that operator.

This property reflects the entire text of the drawing operator. If the drawing operator is a text array operator then this property reflects the text of the portion of the array referenced by the [TextSpanIndex](textspanindex.md) property.
