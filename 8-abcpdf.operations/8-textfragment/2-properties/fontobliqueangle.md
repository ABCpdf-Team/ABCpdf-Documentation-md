| [C#] <BR> `double` | n/a | Yes | The skew angle of the font as used for oblique styles to simulate italic. |

## Notes

The skew angle of the font as used for oblique styles to simulate italic. Measured in degrees clockwise from the vertical.

An italic style is not the same as an oblique style though the two are often confused. An italic style contains different glyphs to a regular style and these glyphs often appear slanted. If a true italic style is not available one can be synthesized by applying a skew to tilt the characters to the right. This is known as an oblique style.

A typical skew angle is between ten and fifteen degrees. So, while it is an arbitrary judgment, any angle above about eight degrees may be regarded as an oblique style.
