# Resolve Function

Get the IndirectObject that the reference is pointing to.

## Syntax

**[C#]**

```csharp
IndirectObject Resolve(ObjectSoup objects)
```

**[Visual Basic]**

`Function Resolve(objects As ObjectSoup) as IndirectObject`
## Params

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| objects | The collection of objects to be searched. | 
| return | The matching IndirectObject. | 

## Notes

This function resolves a RefAtom to the [IndirectObject](../../../6-abcpdf.objects/1-indirectobject/default.md) that it references.

If the RefAtom is referencing another RefAtom then the Resolve process will continue until an Atom which is not a RefAtom is found. If no item is found then null is returned.
