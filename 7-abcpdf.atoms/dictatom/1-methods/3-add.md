## Syntax

may throw ArgumentException() may throw ArgumentNullException()

## Params

## Notes

This method adds an item to the dictionary.

You can add an Atom directly into the dictionary or you can use one of the overloaded operators to add numbers or strings.

When you add a string this is encapsulated within a StringAtom and then inserted. When you add an integer or floating point value this is converted to a NumAtom and then inserted. These operations are more efficient than creating an Atom and adding it yourself.

Atoms can exist in only one place at a time. If the Atom supplied is already contained by another object then a Clone of the Atom is added.

Adding a null value will result in a NullAtom being added to the dictionary.

If the key is null then this method will throw an ArgumentNullException. If the key is already present in the dictionary then this method will throw an ArgumentException.

## Example

None.
