# Acknowledgements

ABCpdf incorporates a variety of freely available and open source software. Many thanks to the authors and contributors.

If you are planning to redistribute ABCpdf you should reproduce these acknowledgments in your documentation.

We use open source if it is available under a non-restrictive license. So Apache, MIT, MPL, BSD, LGPL and similar are all judged to be reasonable and appropriate.

However we do not use software available under the GPL because we think that the legal burdens it imposes on us and our clients are too high.

Some of our intellectual property may be assigned, shared or otherwise jointly held between multiple companies for the purposes of creating a coordinated package.
