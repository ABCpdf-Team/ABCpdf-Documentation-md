# How does it work?

ABCpdf .NET gets up close and personal! Because it doesn't use any print drivers and goes Direct to PDF it's incredibly fast.

Because it's fully multithreaded you can use it flexibly within any .NET environment from ASP.NET to COM+ to straight Windows applications..

In other products you should look out for external libraries. Threading make no difference at all if further down the line a third-party piece of software pipelines every request.

Because ABCpdf .NET doesn't rely on any other software it can be completely multithreaded without any unpleasant bottlenecks.
