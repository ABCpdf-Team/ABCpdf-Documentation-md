| Represents the "P" entry of the target dictionary object. It is defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification. This property may contain one of two different types:. 1) An integer representing a PDF numeric object. 2) A string representing a PDF string object. This string contains raw byte data. So it looks like a string but really it is just a wrapper for data. For definitive details see:. The ISO PDF Specification, ISO 32000-1:2008 PDF 1.7; Table: 202, page 420. The ISO PDF Specification, ISO 32000-2:2017 PDF 2.0; Table: 205, page 510. |  |  |
