# EntryP Property

## Notes

Represents the "P" entry of the target dictionary object.

It is defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification.

This property may contain one of two different types:.

1) An integer representing a PDF numeric object.

2) A string representing a PDF string object.

This string contains raw byte data. So it looks like a string but really it is just a wrapper for data.

For definitive details see:.
