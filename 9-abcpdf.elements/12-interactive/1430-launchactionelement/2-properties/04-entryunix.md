| Represents the "Unix" entry of the launch action object. It is an optional entry defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification. It was deprecated in PDF 2.0. The specification defines this property as being of undefined type. So the type of atom or data contained is not part of the specification. For practical purposes this means it may be of any type. It contains an Element. For definitive details see:. The ISO PDF Specification, ISO 32000-1:2008 PDF 1.7; Table: 203, page 422. The ISO PDF Specification, ISO 32000-2:2017 PDF 2.0; Table: 207, page 513. |  |  |
