## Notes

Represents the "D" entry of the go-to action object.

It is a required entry defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification.

This property may contain one of three different types:.

1) A string representing a PDF name object.

2) A string representing a PDF string object.

This string contains raw byte data. So it looks like a string but really it is just a wrapper for data.
