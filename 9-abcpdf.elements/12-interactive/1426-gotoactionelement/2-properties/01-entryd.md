| Represents the "D" entry of the go-to action object. It is a required entry defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification. This property may contain one of three different types:. 1) A string representing a PDF name object. 2) A string representing a PDF string object. This string contains raw byte data. So it looks like a string but really it is just a wrapper for data. 3) A DestinationElement. For definitive details see:. The ISO PDF Specification, ISO 32000-1:2008 PDF 1.7; Table: 199, page 418. The ISO PDF Specification, ISO 32000-2:2017 PDF 2.0; Table: 202, page 507. |  |  |
