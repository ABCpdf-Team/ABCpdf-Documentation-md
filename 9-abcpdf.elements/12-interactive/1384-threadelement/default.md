| This class represents the thread dictionary. This is definitively detailed in:. The ISO PDF Specification, ISO 32000-1:2008 PDF 1.7; Table: 160, page 376. The ISO PDF Specification, ISO 32000-2:2017 PDF 2.0; Table: 162, page 457. This class is always an indirect object because BeadElement.EntryT, CatalogElement.EntryThreads and ThreadActionElement.EntryD require it to be so. ``` System.Object WebSupergoo.ABCpdf13.Elements.Element WebSupergoo.ABCpdf13.Elements.ThreadElement ``` |  |  |
