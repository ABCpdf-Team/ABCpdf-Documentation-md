|  |  |  | 
| ValidationBase class. This is a class derived from Validation that stores and reports the validation status of Elements that are being validated. It implements a variety of useful features like the detection and resolution of recursive loops, a stack trace and a coverage option. For custom validation reports you will generally want to derive from this class and implement any abstract methods. ``` System.Object WebSupergoo.ABCpdf13.Elements.Validation WebSupergoo.ABCpdf13.Elements.ValidationBase ``` |  |  |
