| Gets or sets the coverage. The coverage is a set of the names of the types of Elements that have been created during validation. The default value of this property is null which means that coverage information will not be recorded. To record coverage information, assign a HashSet to this property. The values in the HashSet are preserved so you can use one HashSet to determine the coverage of a group of documents. |  |  |
