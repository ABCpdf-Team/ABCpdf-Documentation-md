## Notes

Gets the stack trace.

[Validation](0007-validation/default.md) is a recursive process. One [Element](1086-element/default.md) validates each of its child [Elements](1086-element/default.md). Each of those in turn validate their children.

In the event that an inconsistency is found, it useful to know how the current [Element](1086-element/default.md) was arrived at.

This property allows you to get the current stack trace stack including all parents up to the root.
