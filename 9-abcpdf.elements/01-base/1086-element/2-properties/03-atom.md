# Atom Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp Atom ``` [Visual Basic] `Atom` | null | Yes | Gets any Atom that is part of this Element. | 

## Notes

Gets any Atom that is part of this [Element](../default.md).

When an Atom is provided during construction, this may be a reference to an IndirectObject rather than a direct reference to an Atom.

If this is the case then the reference needs to be resolved through to an Atom.

This property stores the resolved Atom - usually a [DictAtom](06-dictatom.md) but occasionally other types for some specific types of [Element](../default.md).

However this property will never be a RefAtom as all references have been resolved.

## Example

None.
