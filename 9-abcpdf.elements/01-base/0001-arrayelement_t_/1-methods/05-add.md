| Add an Element to the end of the array. This method adds an Element to the array. Most ArrayElements cannot hold null values in a meaningful way. So in general, if you provide a null value this will result in an exception being raised. Occasionally it is appropriate for ArrayElements to hold null values represented as NullAtoms. You can indicate this is acceptable, by setting the Nullable property. |  |  |
