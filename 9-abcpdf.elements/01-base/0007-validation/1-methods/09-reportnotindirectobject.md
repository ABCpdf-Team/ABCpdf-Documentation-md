## Notes

Called to report an object which should be indirect but is not.

Some entries are required to be indirect - to refer to an IndirectObject.

For example Page objects are always indirect and a reference to a Page will always be made via a RefAtom.

In the event that an object which is supposed to be indirect, is not, this function will be called.
