| Called to report detection of a recursive structure. Recursive structures are unusual but they can exist. For example a Page object might contain a reference to itself. This needs to be detected to avoid a recursive loop in which the Page validates itself over and over again. In the event that this type of recursion is detected, this function will be called. |  |  |
