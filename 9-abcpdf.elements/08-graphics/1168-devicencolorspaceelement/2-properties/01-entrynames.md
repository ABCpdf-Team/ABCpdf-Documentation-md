# EntryNames Property

## Notes

This property represents the names of the colors within the DeviceN color space.

The names are arbitrary values such as "Seabreeze" which are intended for human readability.

These may include the special value "None" which indicates no color, but may not include the special value "All".

Each name should be unique, with the exception of the special value "None" which may be repeated.
