# EntryTR Property

## Notes

Represents the "TR" entry of the graphics state parameter dictionary object.

It is an optional entry defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification. It was deprecated in PDF 2.0.

This property may contain one of two different types:.

1) A string representing a PDF name object.

If provided, this item must always take the value "Identity".

2) An array which contains FunctionElements.

If you read the specification you will see that an array of one FunctionElement may be represented as a single FunctionElement rather than an array. However we always present this property as an array to simplify the interface. It is only if you add or remove items in the array, that the underlying representation will be changed.
