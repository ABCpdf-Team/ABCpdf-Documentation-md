## Notes

Represents the "U3DPath" entry of the 3d view dictionary object.

It is defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification.

It contains an array which contains strings, representing PDF string objects.

If you read the specification you will see that an array of one string may be represented as a single string rather than an array. However we always present this property as an array to simplify the interface. It is only if you add or remove items in the array, that the underlying representation will be changed.
