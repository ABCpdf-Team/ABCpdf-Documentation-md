## Notes

Represents the "Start" entry of the movie activation dictionary object.

It is an optional entry defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification.

This property may contain one of three different types:.

1) An integer representing a PDF numeric object.

It should have a minimum value of 0.

2) A string representing a PDF string object.

This string contains raw byte data. So it looks like a string but really it is just a wrapper for data.

3) An array which contains [Elements](../../../01-base/1086-element/default.md).
