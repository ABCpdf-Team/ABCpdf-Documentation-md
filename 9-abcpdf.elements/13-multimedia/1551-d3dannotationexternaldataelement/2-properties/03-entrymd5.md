Represents the "MD5" entry of the external data dictionary used to markup 3d annotations object.

It is an optional entry defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification.

It contains a string representing a PDF string object.

This string contains raw byte data. So it looks like a string but really it is just a wrapper for data.
