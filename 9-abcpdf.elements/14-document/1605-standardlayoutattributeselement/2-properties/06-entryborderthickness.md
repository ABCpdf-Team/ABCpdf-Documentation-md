# EntryBorderThickness Property

## Notes

Represents the "BorderThickness" entry of the standard layout attributes object.

It is an optional entry defined as part of the PDF 1.5 specification.

It contains an array which contains doubles, representing PDF numeric objects.

Items in this array should have a minimum value of 0.

If you read the specification you will see that an array of one double may be represented as a single double rather than an array. However we always present this property as an array to simplify the interface. It is only if you add or remove items in the array, that the underlying representation will be changed.
