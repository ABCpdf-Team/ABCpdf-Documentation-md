## Notes

Represents the "FS" entry of the full file specification dictionary object.

It is an optional entry defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification.

It contains a string representing a PDF name object.

The specification defines this as exensible which means that it may contain entries in addition to those defined in the specification.

In fact almost all objects are extensible but the fact that it is explicitly mentioned, implies that extra entries should be regarded as normal rather than exceptional.
