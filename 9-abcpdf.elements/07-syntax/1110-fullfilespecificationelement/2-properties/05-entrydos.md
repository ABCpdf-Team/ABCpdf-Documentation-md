## Notes

Represents the "DOS" entry of the full file specification dictionary object.

It is an optional entry defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification. It was marked obsolescent in PDF 1.7 and deprecated in PDF 2.0.

It contains a string representing a PDF string object.

This string contains raw byte data. So it looks like a string but really it is just a wrapper for data.
