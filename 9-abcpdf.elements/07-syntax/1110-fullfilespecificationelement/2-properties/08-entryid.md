# EntryID Property

## Notes

Represents the "ID" entry of the full file specification dictionary object.

It is an optional entry defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification.

It contains an array which contains strings, representing PDF string objects.

This string contains raw byte data. So it looks like a string but really it is just a wrapper for data.
