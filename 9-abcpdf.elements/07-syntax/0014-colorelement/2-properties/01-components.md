| The component intensities for the color. For example an RGB color has three values between zero and one, a CMYK color has four between zero and one. Colors only make sense in the context of a color space that specifies what the components represent. Most components range between zero and one. However some color spaces such as Lab have components with values outside this range. |  |  |
