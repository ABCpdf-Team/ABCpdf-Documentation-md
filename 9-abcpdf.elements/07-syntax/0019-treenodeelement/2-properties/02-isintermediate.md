| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description |

| **[C#]** ```csharp bool ``` [Visual Basic] `Boolean` | false | Yes | Nodes in a tree may be root, intermediate or leaf. | 

## Notes

Nodes in a tree may be root, intermediate or leaf.

This property indicates if the node is an intermediate node or not.

We can know this because an intermediate node has a "Kids" entry and is not a root node.

None.
