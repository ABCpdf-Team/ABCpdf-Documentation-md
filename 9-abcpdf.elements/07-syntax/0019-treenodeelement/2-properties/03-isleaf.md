# IsLeaf Property

| Type | Default Value | Read Only | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[C#]** ```csharp bool ``` [Visual Basic] `Boolean` | false | Yes | Nodes in a tree may be root, intermediate or leaf. | 

## Notes

Nodes in a tree may be root, intermediate or leaf.

This property indicates if the node is a leaf node or not.

We can know this because a leaf node does not have a "Kids" entry and is not a root node.

## Example

None.
