# EntryID Property

## Notes

Represents the "ID" entry of the page object object.

It is an optional entry defined as part of the PDF 1.3 specification.

It contains a string representing a PDF string object.

This string contains raw byte data. So it looks like a string but really it is just a wrapper for data.
