# EntryContents Property

## Notes

Represents the "Contents" entry of the page object object.

It is an optional entry defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification.

It contains an array which contains StreamElements.

If you read the specification you will see that an array of one StreamElement may be represented as a single StreamElement rather than an array. However we always present this property as an array to simplify the interface. It is only if you add or remove items in the array, that the underlying representation will be changed.
