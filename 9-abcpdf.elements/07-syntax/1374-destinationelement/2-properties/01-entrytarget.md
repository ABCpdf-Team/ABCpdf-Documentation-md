# EntryTarget Property

## Notes

This property represents the destination target.

It is a required entry and defined as part of the PDF 1.0 specification.

The Target may be a PageObjectElement or, in the case of a remote destination, an Element containing a NumAtom indicating a page number. In this case page numbers use a zero rather than one based index.

In a PDF 2.0 document this property may be a StructureElementElement indicating the part of the document to which the destination refers.
