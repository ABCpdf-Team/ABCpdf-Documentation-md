# Histogram Effect

Histogram is a image diagnostic rather than an image effect. When you apply the Histogram effect color levels are calculated and returned via the settings. The image is unaffected.

## Settings

| Name | Default | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red | "" | A histogram of red levels as a comma delimited string. | 
| Green | "" | A histogram of green levels as a comma delimited string. | 
| Blue | "" | A histogram of blue levels as a comma delimited string. | 
| RGB | "" | A histogram of RGB levels as a comma delimited string. | 

## Workings

Image histograms show how color levels are distributed within an image. Each color channel has a value between 0 and 255 and the histogram simply returns the number of pixels with each of these values. A light image will have many values at the higher end of the histogram while a dark one will have many values at the lower end.

After the Histogram effect has been applied to an image the settings contain the histograms of each of the color channels and also of a combined RGB channel. These values are held as comma delimited strings.

## Example

The following example images show the effect of Histogram..

[C#]

```csharp
void function() {
  using (Doc doc = new Doc()) {
    AddImagePage(doc, img1); // original image
    doc.Rendering.Save("EffectHistogram.jpg");
    using (ImageLayer layer = AddImagePage(doc, img1)) {
      using (EffectOperation effect = new EffectOperation("Histogram")) {
        effect.Apply(layer.PixMap);
        var pars = effect.Parameters;
        doc.Color.SetRgb(255, 0, 0);
        DrawGraph(doc, pars["Red"].Values);
        doc.Color.SetRgb(0, 255, 0);
        DrawGraph(doc, pars["Green"].Values);
        doc.Color.SetRgb(0, 0, 255);
        DrawGraph(doc, pars["Blue"].Values);
      }
    }
    doc.Rendering.Save("EffectHistogramGraph.jpg");
  }
}

private void DrawGraph(Doc doc, double[] values) {
  double max = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < values.Length; i++)
    max = Math.Max(max, values[i]);
  double[] points = new double[values.Length * 2];
  for (int i = 0; i < values.Length; i++) {
    double x = i * (doc.Rect.Width / values.Length);
    double y = values[i] * (doc.Rect.Height / max);
    points[(i * 2) + 0] = x;
    points[(i * 2) + 1] = y;
  }
  doc.AddPoly(points, false);
}
```
