# Examples

There are many code examples in the documentation. These cover common tasks like adding text, flowing text and adding images.

Every major object method or property has an accompanying code sample. So if you want to know how to use a method like AddText or AddImageFile just look at the code sample.

Code samples also cover operations like rendering HTML pages, paged HTML renders, watermarking, appending PDF documents and drawing pages from one PDF document into another.

For in-situ examples you should look at the example web site that comes installed with ABCpdf.
