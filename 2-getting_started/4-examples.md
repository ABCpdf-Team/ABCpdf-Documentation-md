# Examples

There are many code examples in the documentation. These cover common tasks like [adding text](../5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/addtextstyled.md), [flowing text](../4-examples/02-textflow.md) and [adding images](../4-examples/04-image.md).

Every major object method or property has an accompanying code sample. So if you want to know how to use a method like [AddText](../5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/addtext.md) or [AddImageFile](../5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/addimagefile.md) just look at the code sample.

Code samples also cover operations like [rendering HTML pages](../5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/addimageurl.md), [paged HTML renders](../5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/addimagetochain.md), [watermarking](../5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/addimagecopy.md), [appending PDF documents](../5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/append.md) and [drawing pages from one PDF document into another](../5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/addimagedoc.md).

For in-situ examples you should look at the example web site that comes installed with ABCpdf.
